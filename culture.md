    - All of us use [HKUST-GZ Zulip](zulip.hkust-gz.edu.cn) for topic based discussion, project management, information sharing and seeking for AI's (a robot named `ChatGPT`) help.
    - We have a WeChat group for have lunch and coffee together during workdays.
* Journal artile management: Most of us use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) to manage and share journal articles.
* Coding: All of us use [Github](https://github.com/) to manage code development, our Github org is [CodingThrust](https://github.com/CodingThrust). Most of us use the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) for scientific software development.

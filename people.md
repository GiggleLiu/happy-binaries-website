## Students
#### Yu-Sheng Zhao
Yusheng Zhao is currently a PhD candidate advised by Prof. Jin-Guo Liu. Prior to his doctoral studies, Yusheng Zhao obtained a B.A. in Physics and Computer Science from New York University, followed by an M.A. in Physics from Stony Brook University. During his Master's, he worked under the supervision of Prof. Tzu-Chieh Wei, focusing on Quantum Error Mitigation.

His current research interest includes finding appropriate formulations for hard combinatorial optimization problems, such as binary polynomial optimization, as polynomial optimization problems, and developing methods to solve them. This involves relaxing the resulting polynomial problems into Semidefinite Programs (SDPs) and exploring the use of symmetries and sparsities inherent in the problems to enable solving larger-scale instances effectively.

#### Zhong-Yi Ni
Zhongyi Ni(倪中一) received his dual B.Sc. degrees in Mathematics and Electronic Information Science from Fudan University. He joined Jin-Guo’s group as a Ph.D. student in 2023 and is currently working on scientific computing and quantum error correction. His contributions include maintaining and developing TensorQEC.jl. It is a Julia package that leverages tensor network methodologies to decode and simulate quantum error-correcting codes, enabling systematic analysis of their theoretical and practical properties. Through this work, Zhongyi seeks to advance the integration of foundational quantum information theory with robust computational tools for real-world applications.

#### Xiaofeng Li
LI Xiaofeng (李晓锋) is now pursuing a BEng degree in Artificial Intelligence at HKUST(GZ). He joined Jinguo's group as a research assistant in July 2024, through the opporunity of Undergraduate Research Program (UGRP) . His contributions focus on the development and maintenance of ProblemReductions.jl, a Julia package designed to enable reductions between computationally hard problems, such as Spin Glass and SAT. He aims to build a comprehensive reduction framework of well-known problems and offer unified interfaces for practitioners who want to explore the landscape of computational complexity.

#### Han Wang
Han Wang received her Bachelor’s degree from East China Normal University (ECNU) in 2020 and her Master’s degree in Physics (specializing in Atomic and Molecular Physics) from ECNU in 2023. During her graduate studies in Prof. Jing Qian’s group, she focused on Rydberg atom manipulation, where she engineered high-fidelity quantum gates leveraging Rydberg blockade and anti-blockade effects and developed optimal control protocols to enhance excitation efficiency in neutral-atom quantum systems. In 2024, she joined the research group of Prof. Jinguo Liu, continuing to advance neutral-atom-based quantum technologies. Her current research integrates topologically protected fault-tolerant quantum computation through optimized pulsed protocols and Rydberg-atom-based universal quantum cellular automata design.

#### Kaiwen Jin
Kaiwen Jin (靳开文) obtained B.Sc. degree in Mathematics from Nankai University. He joined the Jin-Guo group as a Ph.D. student in 2024, focusing on automatic differentiation (AD) and numerical algorithms. His work involves the development of AD rules and sensitivity analysis techniques based on AD. He has contributed to deriving backward-mode differentiation rules for linear and semidefinite programs, as well as analyzing the sensitivity of analytic continuation methods for Green’s functions. Through these efforts, he aims to design robust numerical algorithms and implement them in open-source software to tackle practical computational challenges.

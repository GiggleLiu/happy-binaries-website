#### Yu-Sheng Zhao
Yusheng Zhao is currently a PhD candidate advised by Prof. Jin-Guo Liu. Prior to his doctoral studies, Yusheng Zhao obtained a B.A. in Physics and Computer Science from New York University, followed by an M.A. in Physics from Stony Brook University. During his Master's, he worked under the supervision of Prof. Tzu-Chieh Wei, focusing on Quantum Error Mitigation.

His current research interest includes finding appropriate formulations for hard mathematical optimization problems, such as Quantum Ground-State Problem, as polynomial optimization problems, and developing methods to solve them. This involves relaxing the resulting polynomial problems into Semidefinite Programs (SDPs) and exploring the use of symmetries and sparsities inherent in the problems to enable solving larger-scale instances effectively.
